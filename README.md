### Description:
For practice with using Django as well as CSS and HTML for this project we were assigned with the task of creating a functioning Wikipedia-esque webpage, compelte with the ability to create/edit and view various pages that are intially created using markdown, then with a Markdown -> HTML conversion the page would be rendered using a template to both minimize the amount of HTML that would have to be handwritten as well as creating a uniform page style that can be touched upon from one source rather than having to go into each individual HTML file and making changes that way.
